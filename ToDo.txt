Tasks to do:

- Level advancement system    Assignee: (Noah) [DONE]
-- Allow for multiple levels in the engine (currently it only allows for one level)
-- Increment player score by X amount as the player moves through the level
-- Fake a camera "pan" by transforming the backround image as the level advances
-- Pull level length from JSON file for dynamic level configuration

- Enhancements to HUD - show level countdown timer, make it look prettier    Assignee: (?)
-- Probably some sort of overall UI theme
-- Show the countdown until the level is done (will be contained in level data)

- Power-ups    Assignee: (?)
-- Player shield (basically an enemy damage multiplier to reduce the amount of damage they deal)
-- Power hitter (player damage multiplier to increase damage)
-- Bullet size increase
-- Possibly more?

- Boss battles    Assignee: (Noah) [DONE]
-- System for designating boss levels in the JSON level files
-- I honestly think it will probably be loaded in like any other level and then we can just make the enemies really overpowered.

- Main Menu     Assignee: (?) [DONE]
-- Show a leaderboard (this will also require the user score to be persisted when the game ends)
-- Start the game
-- Nice game title and some pretty graphics

- Add sound to levels
-- Configure dynamically via the level manager
